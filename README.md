ingraind is a security monitoring agent built around [RedBPF](https://github.com/redsift/redbpf)
for complex containerized environments and endpoints. The ingraind agent uses eBPF
probes to provide safe and performant instrumentation for any Linux-based environment.

InGrain provides oversight of assets and risks:
 * Your customer data - an employee copying your customer database to their
   personal cloud store.
 * Your infrastructure - an attacker executing a zero day attack to gain access
   to your web servers.
 * Your resources - malware using your users machines compute resources to mine
   cryptocurrency.

This is what `curl https://redsift.com` looks like if seen through ingraind:

## Requirements

 * LLVM/Clang version 9 or newer
 * Rust toolchain [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
 * Linux 4.15 kernel or newer including kernel headers
 * capnproto

## Compile

The usual Rust compilation ritual will produce a binary in `target/release`:

    cargo build --release

or for a kernel version other than the running one:

    env KERNEL_VERSION=1.2.3 cargo build --release

or with a custom kernel tree path (needs to include generated files):

    env KERNEL_SOURCE=/build/linux cargo build --release

##Â Build a docker image

To build a Docker image, make sure the `kernel` directory is populated with
the source tree of the target kernel.

The resulting container is tagged `ingraind` by default, but you can set
additional tags or pass `docker` flags like so:

    docker/build.sh -t ingraind:$(git rev-parse HEAD | cut -c-7)

## Configuration & Run

To get an idea about the configuration [file
structure](https://github.com/redsift/ingraind/wiki/Configuration), consult the
wiki or take a look at the [example config](./config.toml.example) for a full reference.

To start `ingraind`, run:

    ./target/release/ingraind config.toml

Depending on the backends used in the config file, some secrets may need to be
passed as environment variables. These are documented in
[config.toml.example](./config.toml.example), which should be a good starting point,
and a sane default to get `ingraind` running, printing everything to the standard output.

## Repo structure

The `bpf` directory contains the BPF programs written in C. These are compiled
by `build.rs`, and embedded in the final binary, and will be managed by the
grains.

The `ingraind-probes` directory contains the BPF programs written in Rust.
